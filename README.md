Deadlock is a critical issue in concurrent and distributed systems, often leading to system halts and degraded performance. Traditional deadlock avoidance techniques, such as the classic Banker’s Algorithm, are static in nature and operate under predefined resource allocation limits. However, real-world systems are dynamic, with processes and resource requirements constantly changing. This gap inspired the development of the Dynamic Banker’s Deadlock Avoidance Algorithm (DBDAA). The motivation behind DBDAA is to create a more adaptable and intelligent solution that responds effectively to fluctuating demands in modern computing environments. By introducing dynamic analysis and resource prediction mechanisms, DBDAA aims to optimize system throughput and minimize the chances of deadlock without compromising on safety. This project seeks to bridge the limitations of static algorithms by implementing a system that can evaluate and re-evaluate safe states in real-time. Furthermore, DBDAA is designed with scalability in mind, making it suitable for cloud computing, multiprocessor systems, and other high-demand applications. Through this project, we aim to enhance the reliability, flexibility, and efficiency of process scheduling and resource management, ultimately contributing to more stable and responsive computing systems.
